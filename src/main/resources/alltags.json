Have you ever scared a business person by showing them a piece of JUnit test? There is no better, more meaningful and accurate way to communicate about the software we’re developing than tests, so we shouldn’t resign from telling the story about our product just because of crappy BDD tools. Groovy and Spock are nice alternative to bake BDD specifications directly into the code. By creating domain-specific language it’s possible to create specification understandable both for both business and developers, with IDE support, refactoring and static analysis. - Tests are finally not divided into two separate files - It is real pleasure to create readable specification: developers can use all the goodness and syntactic sugar that comes with Groovy - No need to parse any values from strings into numbers/enums/custom formats — they already are Groovy objects with powerful syntax - Fancy automatic formatting with colours is done by IDE itself for free — tests are normal Groovy code - IDE navigation to underlying layers of test by CTRL+click - No need to do any regexp matching, use clumsy annotations and aliases",

One of the most exciting introductions in this release is support for reactive programming, building on the Pivotal Reactor project to support message-driven, elastic, resilient and responsive services. Spring 5 integrates an MVC-like component model adapted to support reactive processing and a new type of web endpoint, functional reactive endpoints. In this talk, we'll look at the net-new Netty-based web runtime, how existing Servlet code can run on the new world, and how to integrate it with existing Spring-stack technologies. Josh Long, Pivotal Josh (@starbuxman) is the Spring Developer Advocate at Pivotal. Josh is a Java Champion, author of 5 books (including O'Reilly's upcoming \"Cloud Native Java: Designing Resilient Systems with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Cloud Foundry\") and 3 best-selling video trainings (including \"Building Microservices with Spring Boot Livelessons\" w/ Phil Webb), and an open-source contributor (Spring Boot, Spring Integration, Spring Cloud, Activiti and Vaadin) Recorded at Jfokus 2018 https://www.jfokus.se/jfokus18/schedule.jsp",

  "Description" : "Red Hatter Jamie Duncan gives a technical overview of Kubernetes, an open source container orchestration system, in just five minutes. In this video, Duncan says container technologies like Docker are \"making us rethink how we deliver software.\" But they have their limits. Scaling them requires an important tool for extending their purchase: Kubernetes. To some, it’s the future of IT—one in which containers play an increasingly important role.",

  "Description" : "Subscribe to Devoxx on YouTube @ https://bit.ly/devoxx-youtube Like Devoxx on Facebook @ https://www.facebook.com/devoxxcom Follow Devoxx on Twitter @ https://twitter.com/devoxx Microservices are small services with independent lifecycles that work together. There is an underlying tension in that definition - how independent can you be when you have to be part of a whole? I've spent much of the last couple of years trying to understand how to find the right balance, and in this talk/tutorial I'll be presenting the core seven principles that I think represent what makes microservices tick. After a brief introduction of what microservices are and why they are important, we'll spend the bulk of the time looking at the principles themselves: * Modelled Around Business Domain * Culture Of Automation * Hide Implementation Details * Decentralize All The Things! * Deploy Independently * Isolate Failure * Highly Observable In terms of learning outcomes, I'd say that beginners will get a sense of what microservices are and what makes different, whereas more experienced practitioners will get an insight into practical advice into how to implement them.",

So, here's a node.js introduction for those who have no idea what it is. We're going to cover the difference between javascript in a browser vs javascript in node.js and the common uses for node.js. To wrap it up, we're going to spin up a quick web server in node.js just to show you how easy it is. Now, learn how to build an Express.js App! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMIyTH9wSg",

Apache Kafka is a distributed, scalable, and fault-tolerant streaming platform, providing low-latency pub-sub messaging coupled with native storage and stream processing capabilities. Integrating Kafka with RDBMS, NoSQL, and object stores is simple with Kafka Connect, which is part of Apache Kafka. KSQL is a SQL streaming engine for Apache Kafka, and makes it possible to build stream processing applications at scale, written using a familiar SQL interface. In this talk we’ll explain the architectural reasoning for Apache Kafka and the benefits of real-time integration, and we’ll build a streaming data pipeline using nothing but our bare hands, Kafka Connect, and KSQL. Gasp as we filter events in real time! Be amazed at how we can enrich streams of data with data from RDBMS! Be astonished at the power of streaming aggregates for anomaly detection!",

  "Title" : "10 Tips for failing badly at Microservices by David Schmitz",
  "Description" : "This video was moved to Voxxed Days Vienna channel. See here: https://youtu.be/r8mtXJh3hzM Microservices are just a bunch hip new framework plus some AngularJS frontend or React, right? So, if you want to make sure that you absolutely and definitely fail at your Microservice project, then watch this talk and learn how. Using real world experience from multiple green field and brown field projects, I can show you: - how to ignore the mandatory organizational impact - how to focus on the code only without any regard towards ops and testing - continuous deployment is for losers. Real projects use their meat cloud for delivery - jumping onto every new and untested framework is a must - EventSourcing and CQRS are both free lunches. So, you can add complexity without any real need - ...and more",
