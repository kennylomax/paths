  "Title" : "Istio Platform vs Spring and MicroProfile Frameworks - Ozzy Osborne, IBM UK",
  "Description" : "Istio Platform vs Spring and MicroProfile Frameworks - Ozzy Osborne, IBM UK\n\nIstio is an open platform which aims to provide a uniform way to connect, manage and secure microservices. However, these are capabilities that are already provided by a variety of programming frameworks, such as Netflix OSS and MicroProfile fault tolerance. Can a platform really know everything about an application, or does the application sometimes know better?\n\nIn this session Ozzy will start with an introduction to the Istio architecture, including the sidecar model and what it means to deploy your application in this way. He will cover the technologies that overlap with existing framework capabilities such as security and fault tolerance. The differences between the approaches will be highlighted, including when to use which and how you can make them work in harmony together.\n\nIstio also provides capabilities that compliment existing microservice and cloud native architectures. He will cover some of these functions, such as smart routing to enable A/B testing and canary deployments, together with how to make use of them within this new platform. \n\nAbout avatar for Ozzy Osborne\nOzzy has over two decades of experience in Enterprise Software Development for IBM, mainly working with Java based technologies and enterprise middleware. An enthusiastic developer, who loves to \"make things work\", and isn't scared to take things apart to figure out how, he has most recently been focused on Cloud Native architectures centered around Kubernetes, and what the arrival of Istio means for the accepted definition of Cloud Native applications.",

Have you ever scared a business person by showing them a piece of JUnit test? There is no better, more meaningful and accurate way to communicate about the software we’re developing than tests, so we shouldn’t resign from telling the story about our product just because of crappy BDD tools.\n\nGroovy and Spock are nice alternative to bake BDD specifications directly into the code. By creating domain-specific language it’s possible to create specification understandable both for both business and developers, with IDE support, refactoring and static analysis.\n\n- Tests are finally not divided into two separate files\n- It is real pleasure to create readable specification: developers can use all the goodness and syntactic sugar that comes with Groovy\n- No need to parse any values from strings into numbers/enums/custom formats — they already are Groovy objects with powerful syntax\n- Fancy automatic formatting with colours is done by IDE itself for free — tests are normal Groovy code\n- IDE navigation to underlying layers of test by CTRL+click\n- No need to do any regexp matching, use clumsy annotations and aliases",

  "Title" : "Reactive Spring by Josh Long",
  "Description" : "Spring Framework 5 is here! One of the most exciting introductions in this release is support for reactive programming, building on the Pivotal Reactor project to support message-driven, elastic, resilient and responsive services. Spring 5 integrates an MVC-like component model adapted to support reactive processing and a new type of web endpoint, functional reactive endpoints. In this talk, we'll look at the net-new Netty-based web runtime, how existing Servlet code can run on the new world, and how to integrate it with existing Spring-stack technologies.\n\nJosh Long, Pivotal\nJosh (@starbuxman) is the Spring Developer Advocate at Pivotal. Josh is a Java Champion, author of 5 books (including O'Reilly's upcoming \"Cloud Native Java: Designing Resilient Systems with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Cloud Foundry\") and 3 best-selling video trainings (including \"Building Microservices with Spring Boot Livelessons\" w/ Phil Webb), and an open-source contributor (Spring Boot, Spring Integration, Spring Cloud, Activiti and Vaadin)\n\nRecorded at Jfokus 2018\nhttps://www.jfokus.se/jfokus18/schedule.jsp",
